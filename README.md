# Student-database-system
The student database management system project is a program developed using the C programming language that allows users to manage a database of student records. The program allows users to perform various operations on the student records, such as adding new students, editing existing students, deleting students, and searching for students.

The program uses a struct to store the student information, which includes fields for the student's name, ID, and grades. An array of structs is used to store all of the student records. The program uses a command-line interface for user interaction, where users can enter commands to perform different operations on the student records.

The program has several functions that perform specific tasks. For example, the addStudent function allows users to add a new student record to the database, while the editStudent function allows users to make changes to an existing student record. The delStudent function allows users to delete a student record from the database, and the searchStudent function allows users to search for a specific student by name or ID. The view function allows users to view all student records in the database.

The program uses a text file to store the student records. The file is created and populated with data when the program is first run. The file is updated with any changes made to the student records, such as adding, editing, or deleting students.

It is important to note that this is a simple demonstration project and should not be used to store sensitive information in a real-world setting. Additionally, the program does not include any security measures to protect the student records. For real-world use, it is essential to implement a login system and backup the student records.

Overall, the student database management system project is a good example of how to use C programming to create a program that can manage student records. It provides a solid foundation for developing more advanced and secure student database management systems.
